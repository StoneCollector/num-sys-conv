        <h1>What is a Number System?</h1><br></div>
      
<p>A computer can understand only a few symbols called digits and these symbols describe different values depending on the position they hold in the number. In general, the binary number system is used in computers. However, the octal, decimal and hexadecimal systems are also used sometimes.<br>A number system is a method of writing numbers that is a mathematical way of representing the numbers of a given set by mathematically using numbers or symbols. A number system is defined as a writing system for denoting numbers logically using digits or symbols. The numeral system represents a useful set of numbers, reflects a number’s arithmetic and algebraic structure, and offers standard representation. </p>

<div id="container"><h1>Binary Number System</h1><p>The most basic unit of storage in a device is represented by a bit. A computer uses a bit to show any sort of information. Transistors are an important part of a computer system allowing current to flow in a device. It can either be on or off.The binary number system is the most fundamental number system used in computer science. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all numbers and data.</p></div> <br><br>
<div id="container"><h1>Decimal Number System</h1><p>The decimal number system is also used in computer science, but it is not as fundamental as the binary system. It uses ten digits, 0 through 9, to represent numbers.he decimal number system is the most common number system we use in our daily lives. This number system has only 10 digits as it uses numbers from 0 and ends at 9. All digits have their own place value according to their position.

With each movement from right to left, the number value increases by 10. The position on the left of the decimal is for tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on units.</p></div>
<br><br>
   
<div id="container"><h1>Hexadecimal Number System</h1><p>The hexadecimal number system uses 16 digits, including 0 through 9 and A through F, to represent numbers. It is often used in computer programming and digital electronics.Computers find it easy to understand the binary number system and that’s not the case with humans as well. Especially when working on a large number, only binary becomes more prone to errors and mistakes.

In order to overcome this issue, the hexadecimal number system evolved putting binary numbers into a group of four bits. It is a compact approach to represent numbers on the computer as it requires only 4 bits. The hexadecimal number system has a base of 16 which means it uses 16 symbols in total.</p></div> 
<br><br>
  
<div id="container"><h1>Octal Number System</h1><p>The octal number system uses eight digits, 0 through 7, to represent numbers. It is commonly used in computer programming and digital electronics.The last digit of an octal number has the x power of the base. This number system is not very common and used mostly when the number of bits is a multiple of 3. UNIX system and UTF8 numbers use it as a shorthand for file representation.

The reason behind the development of this system was to make binary more compact. It makes binary digits in a group of three instead of four. The base system of eight comes from the decimal number system only. </p></div>
